To make it work:

1 - Git clone https://github.com/Mamba1981/percepto.git

2 - Open project from the cloned folder in an IDE (i used pycharm)

3 - I use python 3.11, set the interpreter

4 - run pip install -r requirements.txt

5 - Add secrets file json to the project, since its gitignored

6 - run pytest -m percepto 

or

   run it from tests folder from test_percepto.py vi IDE UI
